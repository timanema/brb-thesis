\section{Your contribution}
% In computer science typically the third section contains an exposition of the main ideas, for example the development of a theory, the analysis of the problem (some proofs), a new algorithm, and potentially some theoretical analysis of the properties of the algorithm.

% Do not forget to give this section another name, for example after the method or idea you are presenting.

% Some more detailed suggestions for typical types of contributions in computer science are described in the following subsections.

% \subsection*{Experimental work}
% In this case, this section will mostly contain a description of the methods/algorithms you will be comparing. Although not all methods need to be described in detail (providing appropriate references are available), make sure that you reveal sufficient details to a reader not familiar with these methods to: a) obtain a high-level understanding of the method and differences between them, and b) understand your explanation of the results.

% \subsection*{Improvement of an idea}
% In this case, you would need to explain in detail how the improvement works. If it is based on some observation that can be proven, this is a good place to provide that proof (e.g., of the correctness of your approach).
