\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the topic and explain why it is important (motivation!).

\item Relate to the most relevant existing work from the literature (use BibTeX) \cite{example}, explain their contributions, and (critically) indicate what is still unanswered. 


\item Explain what the research questions for this work are. 
This usually is a subset of the unanswered questions. 

\item Summarize the main contributions/conclusions of this research.
NB: Make sure the title of the paper is a good match to the main research question / contribution / conclusion.

\item Briefly indicate how the rest of the paper fits together to answer the research question.
\end{itemize}

For a longer research paper, a section with more elaborate discussion of the literature may follow, but for short (conference) submissions, this is often included in the introduction.
