\begin{abstract}
\textbf{In this paper we consider the Reliable Communication and Byzantine Reliable Broadcast problems on partially connected networks with authenticated links. We consider the RC problem on partially connected networks, and the BRB problem on partially and fully connected networks. Danny Dolev's protocol works on the former, while Gabriel Bracha's \textit{authenticated double echo} protocol works on the latter in the case of a fully connected network. By layering the two protocols the BRB problem can be solved for partially connected networks.
The state-of-the-art protocols for these problems focus on unknown topologies, whereas we focus on known topologies. We show that these problems can be optimized when processes leverage this knowledge. Our simulations with our profiler show that we can drastically increase the message complexity and network usage (e.g., a reduction of XXX\% and XXX\% respectively with a 12B payload when N=150 and f=20 respectively) compared to naive with our optimizations and disjoint path solver.}

% The abstract should be short and give the overall idea:
% what is the background, the research questions, what is contribution, and what are the main conclusions.
% It should be readable as a stand-alone text (preferably no references to the paper or outside literature).
